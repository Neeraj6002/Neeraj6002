# Hi there, I'm Neeraj J ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Neeraj, a web developer who creates websites that balance functionality with clean, modern design. What started as curiosity about how websites work has grown into a skill set focused on building fast, responsive, and user-friendly digital solutions. Every project I take on is guided by performance, usability, and attention to detail. Iâ€™ve worked on projects ranging from interactive interfaces to workflow optimizations, each requiring critical thinking and creative problem-solving. My approach centers on understanding the userâ€™s perspective, applying the latest technologies, and turning ideas into functional websites that make a lasting impact.
